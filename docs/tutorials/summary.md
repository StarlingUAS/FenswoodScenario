# Summary and Conclusion

Congratulations! You have gotten to the end of this tutorial!

Especially if this is your first time touching linux and using this stuff, a lot of the content here can be daunting - but feel free to read it over again and hopefullly you will slowly come to understand what is going on.

In this introductory tutorial, we have only really scratched the surface of a lot of the technologies that we've been using. If you wish to have a deeper understanding, I would recommend having a read through the official documentation of all of them. The [docker](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial) and [ROS2 tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html) are really good. But I wish to emphasise that you will hopefully not need an extremely deep understanding to use Starling.

The next step after this tutorial is then to cover how you might actually build your own controller. This will go into more detail about Mavlink, ROS2 and Docker - including how to build your own projects and run them against the Fenswood Scenario Simulator!
