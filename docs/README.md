# Fenswood Farm

## Introduction

This repository provides a tutorial, template and overview for running the Fenswood Scenario in detail. It will take the student through the basics of Linux, Ros and Docker to hopefully run and edit the Fenswood Scenario simulation environment, followed by developing a simple controller to hopefully fly a drone! 

This tutorial is split into two parts.

1. Basics of Linux, ROS and Docker on this site (starting here):
    - [https://starlinguas.github.io/FenswoodScenario/tutorials/fenswood_scenario/](https://starlinguas.github.io/FenswoodScenario/tutorials/fenswood_scenario/tutorials/intro_to_linux)
2. Fenswood Volcano Template Tutorials where you will learn how to create and build your controller
    - [https://starlinguas.github.io/fenswood_volcano_template/](https://starlinguas.github.io/fenswood_volcano_template/)

## How to use this Tutorial

This Tutorial aims to give an introductory overview of the Starling system through the use of the Fenswood Scenario example. It will take a student from the basics of Linux, ROS and Docker to hopefully being able to run the Fenswood Scenario simulation environment with a simple controller flying the drone.

Simply follow along and try and consider what each command is doing. 

This tutorial was written for the University of Bristol Aerial MSc Group Project 2021.
